    "To perform an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean recovery times between Medication A and Medication B, we can use a one-way ANOVA test. This test compares the means of multiple groups and assesses if there is a significant difference among the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the data:\n",
    "Medication A: [10, 12, 14, 11, 13]\n",
    "Medication B: [15, 17, 16, 14, 18]\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Calculate the means of each group.\n",
    "Mean of Medication A = (10 + 12 + 14 + 11 + 13) / 5 = 12\n",
    "Mean of Medication B = (15 + 17 + 16 + 14 + 18) / 5 = 16\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB).\n",
    "SSB = (Number of data points in Medication A * (Mean of Medication A - Overall Mean)^2) + (Number of data points in Medication B * (Mean of Medication B - Overall Mean)^2)\n",
    "    = (5 * (12 - 14)^2) + (5 * (16 - 14)^2)\n",
    "    = 40 + 40\n",
    "    = 80\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Calculate the sum of squares within groups (SSW).\n",
    "SSW = (Deviation of each data point in Medication A from the Mean of Medication A)^2 + (Deviation of each data point in Medication B from the Mean of Medication B)^2\n",
    "    = (10 - 12)^2 + (12 - 12)^2 + (14 - 12)^2 + (11 - 12)^2 + (13 - 12)^2 + (15 - 16)^2 + (17 - 16)^2 + (16 - 16)^2 + (14 - 16)^2 + (18 - 16)^2\n",
    "    = 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4\n",
    "    = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Calculate the degrees of freedom.\n",
    "Degrees of freedom between groups (dfB) = Number of groups - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\n",
    "Degrees of freedom within groups (dfW) = Number of data points - Number of groups = 10 - 2 = 8\n",
    "Total degrees of freedom (dfT) = dfB + dfW = 1 + 8 = 9\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Calculate the mean square between groups (MSB).\n",
    "MSB = SSB / dfB = 80 / 1 = 80\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6: Calculate the mean square within groups (MSW).\n",
    "MSW = SSW / dfW = 20 / 8 = 2.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 7: Calculate the F-value.\n",
    "F-value = MSB / MSW = 80 / 2.5 = 32\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 8: Look up the critical F-value and compare it with the calculated F-value.\n",
    "The critical F-value depends on the desired significance level (e.g., 0.05) and the degrees of freedom between and within groups. For a significance level of 0.05 and dfB = 1, dfW = 8, the critical F-value is approximately 5.32.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 9: Make a conclusion.\n",
    "If the calculated F-value is greater than the critical F-value, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean recovery times between the two medications. In this case, the calculated F-value of 32 is much greater than the critical F-value of 5.32.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, based on this ANOVA test, we have sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean recovery times between Medication A and Medication B at a 0.05 significance level.\n"
