    "To perform a chi-square test to determine if there is a significant difference in the click-through rates between two designs, we can use a chi-square test of independence. This test examines whether there is a relationship between two categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the data:\n",
    "Design A: [100, 120, 110, 90, 95]\n",
    "Design B: [80, 85, 90, 95, 100]\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Create a contingency table with the observed frequencies for each design.\n",
    "|          | Design A | Design B |\n",
    "|----------|----------|----------|\n",
    "| Clicks   | 100      | 80       |\n",
    "| Clicks   | 120      | 85       |\n",
    "| Clicks   | 110      | 90       |\n",

    "Step 2: Calculate the expected frequencies under the assumption of independence.\n",
    "To calculate the expected frequencies, we need to find the row totals, column totals, and the overall total.\n",
    "Row totals for each design:\n",
    "Total for Design A = 100 + 120 + 110 + 90 + 95 = 515\n",
    "Total for Design B = 80 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 100 = 450\n",
    "\n",
    "Column totals for each click category:\n",
    "Total for Clicks = 100 + 80 + 120 + 85 + 110 + 90 + 90 + 95 + 95 + 100 = 1050\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected frequency for each cell:\n",
    "Expected frequency = (row total * column total) / overall total\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected frequency for Design A and Clicks = (515 * 100) / 1050 ≈ 49.05\n",
    "Expected frequency for Design B and Clicks = (450 * 100) / 1050 ≈ 42.86\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Calculate the chi-square statistic.\n",
    "chi-square = Σ((observed frequency - expected frequency)^2 / expected frequency)\n",
    "chi-square = ((100 - 49.05)^2 / 49.05) + ((80 - 42.86)^2 / 42.86) + ((120 - 49.05)^2 / 49.05) + ((85 - 42.86)^2 / 42.86) + ((110 - 49.05)^2 / 49.05) + ((90 - 42.86)^2 / 42.86) + ((90 - 49.05)^2 / 49.05) + ((95 - 42.86)^2 / 42.86) + ((95 - 49.05)^2 / 49.05) + ((100 - 42.86)^2 / 42.86)\n",
    "chi-square ≈ 19.16\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Determine the degrees of freedom.\n",
    "Degrees of freedom = (number of rows - 1) * (number of columns - 1) = (2 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Look up the critical chi-square value and compare it with the calculated chi-square value.\n",
    "The critical chi-square value depends on the desired significance level (e.g., 0.05) and the degrees of freedom. For a significance level of 0.05 and 1 degree of freedom, the critical chi-square value is approximately 3.841.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6: Make a conclusion.\n",
    "If the calculated chi-square value is greater than the critical chi-square value, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the click-through rates between the two designs. In this case, the calculated chi-square value of 19.16 is much greater than the critical chi-square value of 3.841.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, based on this chi-square test, we have sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference in the click-through rates between Design A and Design B at a 0.05 significance level."
