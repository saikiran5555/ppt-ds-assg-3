    "To calculate the standard error of the mean satisfaction score, we need to divide the standard deviation by the square root of the sample size.\n",

    "Given the data: [7, 8, 9, 6, 8, 7, 9, 7, 8, 7]\n",

    "Step 1: Calculate the sample mean.\n",
    "Sample mean = (7 + 8 + 9 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 9 + 7 + 8 + 7) / 10 = 7.8\n",

    "Step 2: Calculate the deviations from the mean for each data point.\n",
    "Deviations from the mean: [-0.8, 0.2, 1.2, -1.8, 0.2, -0.8, 1.2, -0.8, 0.2, -0.8]\n",

    "Step 3: Calculate the squared deviations.\n",
    "Squared deviations: [0.64, 0.04, 1.44, 3.24, 0.04, 0.64, 1.44, 0.64, 0.04, 0.64]\n",

    "Step 4: Calculate the sum of squared deviations.\n",
    "Sum of squared deviations = 0.64 + 0.04 + 1.44 + 3.24 + 0.04 + 0.64 + 1.44 + 0.64 + 0.04 + 0.64 = 9.96\n",

    "Step 5: Calculate the variance.\n",
    "Variance = Sum of squared deviations / (Sample size - 1) = 9.96 / (10 - 1) ≈ 1.107\n",

    "Standard error of the mean = Standard deviation / √Sample size = 1.051 / √10 ≈ 0.332\n",

    "Therefore, the standard error of the mean satisfaction score is approximately 0.332. This value represents the average amount of variation in the sample mean from the true population mean."
